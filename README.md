# cpp_modules

### 1. What is this ?

As a proof of concept, this build customization provides C++ modules support for MSBuild. The module map is extracted as a preprocessing step and then the modules are built in order without having to manually specify the module search paths. When the user compiles a single file (or only a specific set of files) within a project, imported modules in the current project as well as any transitively referenced projects are preprocessed and compiled first as necessary. If the hash of a BMI of a given module does not change during compilation, other files that import it are not rebuilt unless they're otherwise out of date. Existing MSBuild projects can import the provided .targets and .props files, and applications that use CMake to generate the MSBuild projects can just add two lines to CMakeLists.txt (see tests/dag as an example).

### 2. How does this work ?

At the moment the module map extraction is done by asking the compiler to do a regular preprocess of the file, and then running some regular expressions on the result to remove string literals and find the exports and imports. To properly and efficiently support legacy header units, module implementation files, module fragments etc. a dedicated module specific preprocessor will be needed.
For legacy headers, as it appears to be impossible/impractical to find them automatically, they will need to be marked as a legacy header explicitly in the project configuration, and then the set of legacy headers for a project would be the union of its legacy headers and those of any transitively referenced project.
As the CL task's built-in file access tracker did not appear to work, the FileTracker is invoked manually to extract each inputs/outputs of a given compilation (both preprocessing and final), and then GetOutOfDateItems is used to find which files need to be preprocessed and/or compiled. The set of out of date source files for a given project is cached to a file, so that projects which reference it don't need to recompute that set if they need to compile source files from the referenced project.
A module map file is generated for each project that contains the exported/imported modules as well as the full set of compile options for each file (to allow cross-project compilation). Before compiling, a "global" module map is constructed in memory by aggregating the set of module maps for the current and transitively referenced projects. Any duplicate or imported but missing modules abort the build. Ideally this global module map should be kept in memory during the entire build, but currently it gets recreated for every project when building the whole project tree.
A depth first search based algorithm adds the out-of-date leaf modules to a build queue which then builds additional modules as soon as their dependencies have been satisfied. Currently the build queue is serial, but could be replaced with e.g a depth-based concurrent priority queue.
The .ifc BMI files already contain the SHA256 hash of the rest of their content, so just that 32 byte hash can simply and efficiently be read before and after the compilation to see if the BMI changed. If it did not and hence some other files that import it don't need to be rebuilt, to preserve the invariants of the build system which is otherwise timestamp based, their modification timestamp is updated. This optimization doesn't work yet across project boundaries, but there might be a way to fix that as well.
The BMI paths for all of the referenced modules are passed to the compiler, so in principle it shouldn't need to search directories for any modules.
The build customization distinguishes between source files for which an object file needs to be built and those where only building a BMI would be sufficient, but it would need compiler support to only compile the BMI. It would also be useful if the compiler offered a way to compile both, but write out the BMI first, as fast as possible, before going on to create the object file, so then you could start building other sources which import the BMI much sooner and improve scalability. Unless specific sets of files are compiled, MSBuild and the VS IDE builds a project's references first, which is also not ideal for scalability because some modules could be compiled in parallel with other modules from a referenced project if not imported by the former.

### 3. How to build and install it ?

- Clone this repo and use CMake to generate Visual Studio solutions for it.
- Build it. The tool will automatically be installed to `C:/Program Files/cpp_modules` after the build finishes.
